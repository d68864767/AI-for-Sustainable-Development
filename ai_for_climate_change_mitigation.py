## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play a significant role in mitigating climate change. This section provides an overview of how AI can be used to monitor and model climate change and drive solutions for reducing carbon emissions.

## Monitoring and Modeling Climate Change with AI

AI can help in monitoring and predicting climate change by analyzing large amounts of climate data. Machine learning models can be used to predict future climate patterns and inform climate action.

## AI-Driven Solutions for Reducing Carbon Emissions

AI can also contribute to reducing carbon emissions by optimizing energy use, improving energy efficiency, and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict energy demand and optimize energy production.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into how AI technologies can be applied for climate change mitigation.

# Preprocess data
# Note: Replace 'feature_cols' and 'target_col' with your actual feature and target columns

y = climate_data[target_col]

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
