# AI in Sustainable Agriculture

# This script demonstrates a simple AI application in sustainable agriculture: predicting crop yields using a Random Forest model.

# Load the dataset
# The dataset contains information about various factors that can influence crop yields, such as temperature, rainfall, soil type, etc.
# For the purpose of this example, we'll assume that the dataset is a CSV file named 'crop_yield_data.csv'.
data = pd.read_csv('crop_yield_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
# For simplicity, we'll assume that there are no missing values in the dataset and that all data is numerical.
# In a real-world scenario, you would need to perform appropriate preprocessing steps based on the nature of your data.

# Define the target variable (crop yield) and the feature variables
y = data['Yield']
X = data.drop('Yield', axis=1)

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Define the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)

print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")

# This is a simple example of how AI can be used in sustainable agriculture.
# In practice, you would need to use more complex models and preprocessing techniques, and you would also need to consider additional factors such as the spatial and temporal aspects of your data.
